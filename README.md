#### This repository contains code which can be used as "user data" while creating AWS EC2 instances for Client Demo's, POC's and doing hands on Labs. <br/>
<br/>
* These scripts will install an Apache web server (httpd) and would display the private IP and avilability zones of the EC2 instances. <br/>
* They are very useful while testing autoscaling/HA scenarios. A webserver will be installed and will display its AZ & IP (other required meta data can be easily added)<br/>
* There are 3 scripts for (AWS) Linux, Windows 2016 and Windows 2019 servers <br>
* These scripts can be extended with minor changes and can be used for most of the hands on Labs for AWS Solution Architect certifications (SAA & SA Pro).<br/>

## Sample Architectures that can be built for Client Demos, POC's & Labs : <br/>
